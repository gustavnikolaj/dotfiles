# Fix WSLInterop without restarting wsl.
#
# Sometimes, particularly when running kitchen dokken the compatibility layer
# between the WSL Linux side and Windows binaries break. When it works you can
# execute windows binaries (which I rely on for e.g. ssh.exe).
# 
# Reinitializing it like done in this below script causes it to start working
# again.
#
# It seems to happen for me after using kitchen-dokken to test chef cookbooks
# in docker containers. I am using kitchen in WSL running Ubuntu 24.04 on
# Windows 11. I am running Docker Desktop for Windows, with the WSL integration
# enabled, which means that the Docker daemon is itself running inside another
# WSL instance instead of as a daemon on the Windows side.
