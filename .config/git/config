# NOTE: This file contains a bunch of unstaged changes as I am currently evaluating how
#       using a more default git setup would work for me. I don't use most of the aliases
#       any way, with the exception of hist and s. And it seems that for the most part,
#       the values that I set are dated back from before the release of git 2.0, and that
#       the default configuration is very much in line with most of the other configuration
#       options that I set.
